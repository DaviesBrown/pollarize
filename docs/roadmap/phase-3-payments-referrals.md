# Phase 3: Payments & Referrals

**Objective:**
Integrate payment processing, handle refunds, and implement a basic referral reward system to monetize the polling platform.

## Goals

- Models and endpoints for `Payment`, `Refund`, and `ReferralReward`.
- Paystack integration for payment initiation and webhook handling.
- Process refunds and track refund status.
- Issue referral rewards and track reward balances.
- Secure payment endpoints with authentication and signature verification.

## Deliverables

1. Django models and migrations for payments, refunds, and referrals.
2. Payment service layer (`paystack.py`) for API interaction.
3. DRF viewsets/endpoints for initiating payments, receiving webhooks, and managing refunds.
4. Referral reward logic tied to successful vote payments.
5. Tests covering payment flows, webhook security, and referral calculations.
